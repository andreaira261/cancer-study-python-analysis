## Analysis 
Based on the data from the animal study, several observations can be made to examine the performance of Capomulin against other treatment regimens. 

The bar chart displaying the total number of observed mouse timepoints for each drug regimen shows that Capomulin had the highest number of observations with 230, closely followed by Ramicane with 228 observations.

Moreover, when analyzing the tumor volume at the last observed timepoint for each mouse across the four regimens examined (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin), Capomulin showed the smallest IQR, indicating the least variability in the final tumor volume measurement. Ramicane also exhibited similar quartiles to Capomulin. In contrast, mice treated with Infubinol and Ceftamin displayed much larger quartiles in the final tumor volume, suggesting poorer efficacy in treating SCC compared to Capomulin and Ramicane.

Additionally, the line plot of tumor volume versus time point for Mouse l509 treated with Capomulin demonstrated that Capomulin was effective in reducing the tumor size after 45 days, with the most significant effect observed between days 20 and 35, as the tumor volume generally decreased during this period.

Lastly, a strong positive correlation of 0.84 was observed between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen, indicating a positive relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume.

Overall, the study revealed that Capomulin and Ramicane generally had the best results compared to the other drug regimens tested.
